## About

Made this way back in 2013 using impact.js and totally forgot about.
Thought I'd stick it on github for posterity.

## Resolution

320 x 480 (scales to fit viewport)

## Description

You are under attack! Defend yourself against heavily armed, bloodthirsty
rabbits. Eliminate the rabbits! Collect powerups! Battle across meadows, forests
and moutains. Make sure you don't harm any innocent creatures!
